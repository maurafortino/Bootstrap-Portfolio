                                Hi I'm Maura - I'm 24 years old. I was born in Philadelphia and grew up playing
                                soccer
                                starting from the
                                age of four
                                and played all through out college at Capital Univeristy in Columbus, OH. I studied
                                Communications with
                                an
                                emphasis in Public Relations and soon after graduating in 2016 learned that this was
                                not
                                the
                                career for
                                me.
                                I wish I would have figured that out in college.
                            </p>
                            <p class="px-1">
                                After moving home from Columbus, I started self teaching myself how to code while
                                looking
                                for a job as a
                                way to gain some more skills
                                and then realized that I liked it enough to possibly make a career out of it.
                                Currently,I
                                work in
                                fundraising at a
                                local university, but am looking to make a career change into the tech field.
                                Outside of
                                coding, my
                                hobbies include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>reading - last year I read 52 books in 52 weeks</li>
                                    <li>learning new languages - I am almost fluent in Spanish and I'm learning
                                        Italian
                                    </li>
                                    <li>travelling - I want to travel to all 50 states before I turn 50</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
