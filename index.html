                Hi I'm Maura - I'm 24 years old. I was born in Philadelphia and grew up playing soccer starting from the age of four
                and played all through out college at Capital Univeristy in Columbus, OH. I studied Communications with an 
                emphasis in Public Relations and soon after graduating in 2016 learned that this was not the career for me. 
                I wish I would have figured that out in college.
            </p>
            <p>
                After moving home from Columbus, I started self teaching myself how to code while looking for a job as a way to gain some more skills
                and then realized that I liked it enough to possibly make a career out of it. Currently,I work in fundraising at a 
                local university, but am looking to make a career change into the tech field.  Outside of coding, my hobbies include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>reading - last year I read 52 books in 52 weeks</li>
                        <li>learning new languages - I am almost fluent in Spanish and I'm learning Italian</li>
                        <li>travelling - I want to travel to all 50 states before I turn 50</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                If anyone has any book recommendations, please send them my way - or if you're in need of some, let me know
                I love sharing my favorite reads with people. I also just got back into playing Pok&#233;monGo so if anyone wants to be friends
                on that - dm me on slack!
            </p>
